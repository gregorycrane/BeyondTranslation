# Token level Annotations

Here we demonstrate a generalized ability to coordinate multiple -- in an ideal world, arbitrary -- layers of annotation keyed to tokens. NB: this does
not work if we are dealing with morphemes (chunks of words) or (as in a later example) metrical annotations that have boundaries within and across tokens.
