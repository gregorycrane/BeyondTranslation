Beyond Translation constitutes a new environment for reading and for publishing next-generation, born-digital publications in multiple languages. Our goal is to change the way in which audiences view the human record. While all readers will always have to depend upon translations into a language they can understand -- roughly 7,000 languages currently survive. No normal human minds could even learn, much less, master the 24 official languages of the European Union or the 22 official languages of India. Machine translation has begun to expand the range of sources that we can explore in computationally well-resourced languages such as English but students of historical languages, in particular, know that even the best translations are

### Beyond Translation as a medium for publication, preservation, and sustainability.

Rather than making slides for a workshop, why not make a website? 
It's easier to write, access, share, and reuse. 
GitHub and GitHub Pages makes this relatively straightforward.

Writing content in this simple, reuseable format makes for a better [Open Educational Resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) since anyone can make a copy and adapt!

## GitHub Pages 

One amazingly useful GitHub feature is [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).
It provides free static web hosting from any repository.
Gh-pages is intended to host relatively simple sites for your GitHub portfolio, project, or documentation.
Because it is free and a valuable transferable skill, this is a great option for teaching and learning.

Many organizations are using GitHub to collaboratively create and publish public workshop websites. 
For example: 

- [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/)
- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/), [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/)
- this site!

{% capture text %}Note:
There are *soft* limits and guidelines for gh-pages usage: sites should be < 1GB, use < 100GB bandwidth per month, and make < 10 builds per hour.
If your site exceeds these quotas, GitHub will send you a notice asking you to modify the repository.
All content must follow the [community guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/), e.g. no violence, obscene sex, or illegal stuff.{% endcapture %}
