Several earlier projects led to the Perseus Digital Library.
## Harvard Classics Computing Project

The Perseus Digital Library has its origins in the summer of 1982, when Gregory Crane, then a PhD student in the Department of Classics at Harvard, begin, as 
he was told, to help advice programmers on the tweaks needed to adapt the Unix operating system to the study of Ancient Greek language and literature. 

The first task to search the first Greek texts that were published by the TLG. The medium was 9-track magnetic tape and there were a relative handful of texts but this was the first time anyone had distributed machine readable texts of Greek. I can remember that the first file of the first author was Aeschylus' Suppliant Women and I immediately had to deal with non-standard line numbers. Ultimately, I used Michael Lesk's bibliographic Unix utility, Refer, as a model but I could not reuse the code. Lesk had used a technique called hashing that was not nearly so suitable to highly inflected languages such as Greek. In the end, we had a 10,000 line set of programs, written in the C programming language, that could index and search the texts available from the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (then led by its founder, Ted Brunner). This introduced the idea of automated text processing.

In that summer of 1982, the Classics Deparmented invested in 40,000 in running cable through steam tunnels from William James Hall into Widener Library. These were the first network cables ever installed in Widener. They were heavy twisted pair and each cable could support (if memory serves) 32 connections. The cable came in a wooden spool that was c. 5 feet tall. This introduced the possiblity of leaving the machine room establishing remote networks. It would be years before I began to have limited access to Arpanet, the predecessor to the world Wide Web.

We also were asked to address the spiraling costs of typesetting Greek. We adapted the Unix publishing utliity TROFF to Ancient Greek. A consortium involving the Loeb Classical Library, Harvard Studiesin Classical Philology, the Russian Review and the Harvard Theological Review assembled $8,000 to buy a used, film based typesetter. Gary Bisbee created a Greek font and we reduced typesetting costs from c. $25/page to c. $10/page. This project introduced the idea of computer-based publication of secondary sources, editions, translations, and reference works.

## Isocrates (with Paul Kahn of Brown University)

In 1983, I had a chance to begin a collaboration with the Scholarly Workstation Project funded by IBM at Brown University. Paul Kahn led the effort. We exploited a new mediu, CD ROM, that could store more than 500 megabytes on a single, cheap (< $5), lightweight plastic disk. At the time, a 100 megabyte read-write hard disk cost c. $20,000. The CD ROM opened up the possibility of inexpensive publication of unprecedentd amounts of data. We adapted the TLG search system to work on a CD ROM (which required optimization for the slow disk). I got a Unix workstation as payment that would have cost $15,000. That was the first time I had a serious (by the standards of the time) development machine.
