We have integrated two complementary data models. The [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io/) is a set of open standards for delivering high-quality, attributed digital objects online at scale. Itâ€™s also an international community developing and implementing the IIIF APIs. IIIF is backed by a consortium of leading cultural institutions.
