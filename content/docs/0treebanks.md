We first announced plans to develop treebanks for Greek and Latin in 2002, but the idea went back to work on Morpheus in 1984. Morpheus was able to identify that _mênin_, "wrath," was in an accusative singular form of the Greek noun _mênis_, but morphology could not, by itself, to us why _mênin_ was in the accusative. Is it governed by a preposition? Is it an internal accusative ("with respect to wrath") or (for example) simply, as in this case, the direct object of a verb.
