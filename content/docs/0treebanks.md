We first announced plans to develop treebanks for Greek and Latin in 2002, but the idea went back to work on Morpheus in 1984. Morpheus was able to identify that _mênin_, "wrath," was in an accusative singular form of the Greek noun _mênis_, but morphology could not, by itself, to us why _mênin_ was in the accusative. Is it governed by a preposition? Is it an internal accusative ("with respect to wrath") or (for example) simply, as in this case, the direct object of a verb? Treebanks are textual databases which record such linguistic annotation. The Greek Treebank below records (1) the position of each form in a sentence, (2) its inflected form, (3) its dictionary form (_mênis_); (4) its part of speech (n-s---fa- = "noun, singular, feminine, accusative"), (5) the word it depends on (in this case _ennepe_, "sing!"), and (6) its syntactic role (the object of _ennepe_).
