We have begun to add extensive grammatical annotations to particular texts. Treebanks may tell you that a word is in the dative and depends on a verb, but they can't tell you that the dative in this case
designates location ('in the plain') or instrumentality (e.g., 'with rock'). We can now convey this information by highlighting links from a particular word to
a reference grammar.

In the example below, BT highlights those words in the opening of the Iliad that one or more lexica specifically cite in this particular passage.

We have had links from grammars to passages on which they comment, but these links have been relatively underused. There are several reasons for this. 
First, there are not enough links to most passages -- only a few words normally have annotations. Most readers do not check to see if there are grammar notes because the payoff is too infrequent.

Second, the presentation is not obvious. In the figure below, the grammar cross references are hidden down under other cross references -- the easy juxaposition below is an artifact of editing the image. Thus, readers would normally not see these cross references.

Third, finding the actual cross reference can be cumbersome.

{% include figure.html img="bt_grammar03.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="cross references from Smyth and Kuehner Gerth to Thuc. 1.1" width="75%" %}

This leads us to [a fairly large chunk of Smyth]([url](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0007:part=4:chapter=40)). Only after scrolling down and searching visually or by searching the Web browser for "Thuc", do we find the relevant section.

{% include figure.html img="bt_grammar04.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="Words tagged with a particular grammatical feature are highlighted" width="75%" %}
The uncertainty of what will be found and the effort to find the result does not normally inspire readers to invest the time.
