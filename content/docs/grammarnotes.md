We have begun to add extensive grammatical annotations to particular texts. Treebanks may tell you that a word is in the dative and depends on a verb, but they can't tell you that the dative in this case
designates location ('in the plain') or instrumentality (e.g., 'with rock'). We can now convey this information by highlighting links from a particular word to
a reference grammar.

In the example below, BT highlights those words in the opening of the Iliad that one or more lexica specifically cite in this particular passage.
