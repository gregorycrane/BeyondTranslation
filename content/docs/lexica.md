Users of Perseus have, for more than thirty years, been able to move from an inflected form in a text to an online dictionary. Building on additions to the Scaife open source code base for Brill's [Scholarly Translations Infrastucture](https://scholarlyeditions.brill.com/), we can identify which words in a passage are cited by another work (such as a textual notes, a lexicon or a commentary).

In the example below, BT highlights those words in the opening of the Iliad that one or more lexica specifically cite in this particular passage.


{% include figure.html img="linking02-lexicon.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="Words in this passage cited by three different lexica" width="75%" %}

{% include figure.html img="linking03-cunpers.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="Words in this passage cited by Cunliffe's Lexicon of Personal Names in Homer" width="75%" %}

{% include figure.html img="linking04-cunliffe.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="Words in this passage cited by Cunliffe's Lexicon of Personal Names in Homer" width="75%" %}
