Users of Perseus have, for more than thirty years, been able to move from an inflected form in a text to an online dictionary. Building on additions to the Scaife open source code base for Brill's [Scholarly Translations Infrastucture]([url](https://scholarlyeditions.brill.com/)), we can identify which words in a passage are cited by another work (such as a textual notes, a lexicon or a commentary).

In the example below, BT highlights those words in the opening of the Iliad that one or more lexica specifically cite in this particular passage.
